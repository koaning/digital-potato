This will be a place where you can practice your skills by following
a sequence of puzzles. Every time that you're presented with a puzzle
that, once solved, reveals a hidden message.

Typically these puzzles will require you to use one of the tools that
we teach on this platform, but they may require some creativity as you
progress.

The message for this first part is "helloworld". You can fill in this word
in the checker below to find the URL to the next challenge.
