Given that everything is installed, let's give playwright a spin! 

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    # Load the Chrome browser and see it
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://calmcode.io")
    # Grab the title
    print(page.title())
    # Make a screenshot 
    page.screenshot(path="example.png")
    browser.close()
```

When you run this script, you'll see a browser open up. It's
brief, just long enough for playwright to make a screenshot
and then it closes. You can choose to run playwright without
this browser popup by setting `headless=True`, which is the
default setting. 


```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    # Headless mode turned on
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://calmcode.io")
    print(page.title())
    page.screenshot(path="example.png")
    browser.close()
```
